# Splunk SVP Team Take Home

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),
and is designed as a step when interviewing for the SVP Team at Splunk.

## How do I use this?

1. Clone/fork this repo locally
2. Start this app by running `docker-compose up` (install Docker if needed)
3. Create the app specified in `spec.pdf`, by following the requirements below and within `spec.pdf`.
4. When finished, zip the project and upload it Codility.

## Project Requirements

1. Use `spec.pdf` as a visual guide to create a basic log viewing application.
2. The main view should utilize React components when rendering logs to ensure the application stays modular. Do this in the way you feel is best, and we can discuss the chosen approach during the in-person interview.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `docker-compose up`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

From within the docker container `docker-compose exec app`, you can run:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
